    # ExtraDetailingTools

    # Features:
    * Transform Tool
    * More Snapping Option
    * NetLanes
    * Surfaces
    * Decals

    ## Transform Tool
    The Transform UI appears when you select a compatible asset. This allows you to change the positioning and rotation of the object along the XYZ axis. You are also able to change the increment (↕) value. This can provide a lot more precision for positioning and rotation.

    This menu also has a new 'delete' button, for all objects.

    ## ExtraAssetsMenu

    In the games main navigation, you’ll find the ExtraAssetsMenu. In here you’ll find three different tabs:

    ## NetLanes
    Netlanes (NetTool) use the same functionality as road networks, it can be used to create network fencing, or road markings to any length. This tool is more versatile than using prop line tool with fence props.

    ## Surfaces
    There are many custom and vanilla surfaces found in this tab. They are separated into categories such as ground and tiles.

    Note: Surfaces are currently WIP. On launch, the ID will change to the live version, so existing surfaces placed with this beta version of mod will likely break.

    ## Decals
    Here you’ll find custom and vanilla decals. There are decals to place on the ground, like road markings and stains, and decals you can place on vertical walls.

    Note: Decals are currently WIP. On launch, the ID will change to the live version, so existing surfaces placed with this beta version of mod will likely break.

    ## Snap to surface toggle
    This is a feature found in the editor, now in game. This will allow you to place decals like graffiti and posters, on vertical walls. This can also be used to snap any object to any surface. From placing props on rooftops, to stacking objects on top of each other, right up to placing trees horizontally on walls.

    You’ll find this alongside the other snapping options in the games UI.
